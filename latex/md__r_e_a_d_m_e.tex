We view pull requests as a collaborative process. Submit a pull request early to get feedback from the team on work in progress. We will discuss improvements with you and agree to merge them once the \href{https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/blob/master/DEVELOPERS}{\texttt{ developers}} approve.

If you want a step-\/by-\/step walk-\/through on how to set-\/up your workspace, please check \href{https://devdocs.jabref.org/getting-into-the-code/guidelines-for-setting-up-a-local-workspace}{\texttt{ this guideline}}.

To compile Jab\+Ref from source, you need a Java Development Kit 14 and {\ttfamily J\+A\+V\+A\+\_\+\+H\+O\+ME} pointing to this J\+DK. To run it, just execute {\ttfamily gradlew run}. When you want to develop, it is necessary to generate additional sources using {\ttfamily gradlew generate\+Source} and then generate the Eclipse {\ttfamily gradlew eclipse}. For IntelliJ I\+D\+EA, just import the project via a Gradle Import by pointing at the {\ttfamily build.\+gradle}.

{\ttfamily gradlew test} executes all tests. We use \href{https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/actions}{\texttt{ Github Actions}} for executing the tests after each commit. For developing, it is sufficient to locally only run the associated test for the classes you changed. Github will report any other failure.
